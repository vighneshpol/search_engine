# 🚀 Search Engine Project

## Overview

This project aims to build a simple **Search Engine** using **Golang** for the backend and **React.js** for the frontend. The search engine loads structured data from multiple files and allows users to search through it based on various fields like `Message`, `Sender`, `Event`, etc.

### **Backend (Golang)**
- In-memory data loading from files.
- Search endpoint (`/search`) to query the dataset based on a search term.
- Implements a case-insensitive search across relevant fields in the dataset.

### **Frontend (React.js)**
- A simple user interface to input search queries.
- Displays the search results with key data points.
- Shows the time taken for query execution for transparency.

## ✅ Work Done

1. **Backend (Golang)**:
   - Implemented data loading from files located under `parquet_files/`.
   - Set up a basic REST API (`/search`) to accept search queries and return results.
   - Implemented logic to search through important fields (`Message`, `Sender`, `Event`, etc.).
   - Applied case-insensitive matching for search queries.

2. **Frontend (React.js)**:
   - Created the basic React app with a search bar.
   - Connected the search bar to the backend API and displayed search results.
   - Added basic error handling and loading states for the search functionality.

3. **Testing**:
   - Successfully loaded files and data into memory.
   - Validated that the backend is receiving and handling search queries.
   - Search results show as expected for test queries in the terminal (still being refined).

## 🛠 Pending Work

1. **Search Query Issue**:
   - The search query is not returning expected results in the browser or through curl commands.
   - There may be an issue with data parsing from the `.parquet` files or mismatched fields that prevent correct results from being returned.

2. **Search Performance**:
   - Data processing and memory optimization for larger datasets.
   - Add pagination to results to handle large data sets effectively.

3. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Add more user-friendly feedback for no results found or errors.
   - Improve search result formatting (e.g., highlight the matched text).

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error responses for invalid queries or unexpected issues with the backend API.

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend:
- The backend server is running at `http://localhost:8080`.
- Search functionality is tested using `curl` and Postman for various queries.
- **Known Issue**: Search results are returning zero matches for certain queries, potentially due to data structure or search field mismatch.

### Frontend:
- React app can be tested by running it on `http://localhost:3000`.
- User can enter a search query, and results are displayed (currently limited by search issue).

### Unit Testing:
- Unit tests can be written for backend functionality in Go (to be done).

---

## 📝 Notes

- **Known Issues**: The search functionality is still under investigation. While data is loading correctly, the search queries do not return the expected results in some cases.
  
- **Data Files**: The data being used for this project are simulated and stored as files (`File 1`, `File 2`, ... `File 16`). These files are expected to contain structured data for search queries.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. **Backend (Golang)**:
   - Install Golang: [Golang Installation Guide](https://golang.org/doc/install)
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory and run the Go server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     go run main.go
     ```
   - The server will be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. **Frontend (React.js)**:
   - Install Node.js and npm: [Node.js Installation](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the React app:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.
